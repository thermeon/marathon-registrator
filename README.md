Consul service registry bridge for Marathon. It monitors services running by Marathon and syncs them to Consul.
Heavily inspired by [registrator](https://github.com/gliderlabs/registrator).

# Features
* Automatically registers/deregisters Marathon tasks as services in Consul.
* Real-time updates of service registry.
* Uses new Marathon [Event Stream](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/rest-api.html#event-stream)
(e.g. /v2/events) for getting service updates. No need to reconfigure Marathon to use webhooks.
* Automatic cleanup of dangling services from service registry.
* Designed with extensibility in mind: service scheduler and service registry are
abstractions which may have different implementations. Currently, there is only Marathon
scheduler and Consul service registry implemented.
